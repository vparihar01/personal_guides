# Building Rails 3 custom validators
Every validation extends the base class of **ActiveModel::Validator** (which handles validating the whole record) or **ActiveModel::EachValidator** (which handles validating the attribute on the record). The latter module also takes care of **:allow_nil** and **:allow_blank** options for you, so the validations are not even invoked when the value doesn’t match the given conditions.
I’m going to give a quick example of how these two base classes differ.

**Any class that inherits from ActiveModel::Validator must implement a method called validate which accepts a record.**
```ruby
# define my validator
class MyValidator < ActiveModel::Validator
  # implement the method where the validation logic must reside
  def validate(record)
    # do my validations on the record and add errors if necessary
    record.errors[:base] << "This is some custom error message"
    record.errors[:first_name] << "This is some complex validation"
  end
end

class Person
  # include my validator and validate the record
  include ActiveModel::MyValidator
  validates_with MyValidator
end
# This method can be used to validate the whole record
```

```ruby
# This method below, on the other hand, lets you validate one attribute

class TitleValidator < ActiveModel::EachValidator
  # implement the method called during validation
  def validate_each(record, attribute, value)
    record.errors[attribute] << 'must be Mr. Mrs. or Dr.' unless ['Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Dr.'].include?(value)
  end
end
```
The TitleValidator class inherits from ActiveModel::EachValidator. We have to define one method in the class, validate_each, that takes three parameters called object, attribute and value. The method then checks that the value include in array i.e ['Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Dr.'] and if not it will add the attribute to the objects errors.

```ruby
class Person
  include ActiveModel::Validations
  # validate the :title attribute with PresenceValidator and TitleValidator
  validates :title, :presence => true, :title => true
end
```

You might have noticed that in the second example, the TitleValidator is “magically” invoked upon the :title => true option in the validates :title statement.

This is another really cool feature that ActiveModel::Validator introduces – all the options passed to validates method stripped of reserved keys (:if, :unless, :on, :allow_blank, :allow_nil) and the remaining keys are resolved to class names with a const_get("#{key.to_s.camelize}Validator") call.

Having an title key in the validates hash means that the validator will look for a class called title_validator and passes the validation behaviour into the custom class that we just wrote.

```ruby
# this is resolved to BarValidator class
validates :name, :bar => true
```

```ruby
# this is resolved to FancyValidationWithPoniesValidator class
validates :name, :fancy_validation_with_ponies => true
```

```ruby
# and this is what is called internally after resolving the class name
validates_with(FancyValidationWithPoniesValidator, options_and_attributes)
```

One more thing: if the value of a validation method key is a hash, it will be passed as options to the validator.

```ruby
validates :foo, :bar => { :amount => 100, :if => :has_bar?, :on => :save, :allow_nil => true }

# this is what BarValidator is passed as options
options => { :amount => 100, :allow_nil => true }
```
#Email Validators

```ruby
require 'active_model'
require 'active_support/all'
require 'active_model/validations'
require 'mail'

# http://my.rails-royce.org/2010/07/21/email-validation-in-ruby-on-rails-without-regexp/

class EmailValidator < ActiveModel::EachValidator
  def validate_each(record,attribute,value)
    begin
      return true if value.blank?
      m = Mail::Address.new(value)
      # We must check that value contains a domain and that value is an email address
      r = m.domain && m.address == value
      t = m.__send__(:tree)
      # We need to dig into treetop
      # A valid domain must have dot_atom_text elements size > 1
      # user@localhost is excluded
      # treetop must respond to domain
      # We exclude valid email values like <user@localhost.com>
      # Hence we use m.__send__(tree).domain
      r &&= (t.domain.dot_atom_text.elements.size > 1)
    rescue Exception => e
      r = false
    end
    record.errors[attribute] << (options[:message] || "is invalid") unless r
  end
end
```
#Full Name Validator

```ruby
class FullNameValidator < ActiveModel::Validator
  include NameValidator

  def validate(record)
    [:first_name, :last_name].each do |attribute|
      value = record.send(attribute)
      record.errors[attribute] << "can't be blank" if value.blank?

      if !value.blank?
        record.errors[attribute] << "is too short" if value.size < min_length
        record.errors[attribute] << "is too long" if value.size > max_length
        record.errors[attribute] << "has invalid characters" unless value =~ /^[a-zA-Z\-\ ]*?$/
      end
    end
  end

end

#NameValidator modules which needed in fullname validator

module NameValidator
  mattr_accessor :name_max_length
  mattr_accessor :name_min_length

  def self.name_length range
    @@name_min_length = range.min
    @@name_max_length = range.max
  end

  def min_length
    @@name_min_length || 2
  end

  def max_length
    @@name_max_length || 30
  end
end
```

#Account Number validator

```ruby
class AccountNumberValidator < ActiveModel::EachValidator
  def validate_each(record, attribute, value)
    mod_10(value, record, attribute)

    # Basically, the alorithum takes each digit, from right to left and muliplies each second
    # digit by two. If the multiple is two-digits long (i.e.: 6 * 2 = 12) the two digits of
    # the multiple are then added together for a new number (1 + 2 = 3). You then add up the
    # string of numbers, both unaltered and new values and get a total sum. This sum is then
    # divided by 10 and the remainder should be zero if it is a valid credit card. Hense the
    # name Mod 10 or Modulus 10.
